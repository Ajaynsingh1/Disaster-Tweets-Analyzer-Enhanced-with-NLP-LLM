# Disaster-Tweets-Analyzer-Enhanced-with-NLP-LLM
The project aims to build a machine learning model to accurately classify disaster-related tweets. Using advanced NLP techniques and models like BERT, the system will analyze tweet context to identify those related to disasters. This will help in quickly pinpointing critical information during emergencies, improving disaster response efforts.
